# Data-Preprocessing---Titanic-Dataset-task-5

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib
This repository contains an EDA script for performing basic yet comprehensive analysis of tabular datasets using Python's pandas and matplotlib. The dataset used for demonstration is the Titanic dataset, which includes passenger information such as age, sex, class, and survival status.

‚úÖ Features of This EDA
The script performs the following operations:

1. Dataset Loading
Reads a .csv file using pandas.

2. Basic Exploration
Displays dataset shape, column data types, and summary statistics.

Lists value counts for categorical features.

3. Missing Value Analysis
Visual heatmap (using matplotlib) to visualize missing values across rows and columns.

4. Univariate Analysis
Histograms for numeric columns to visualize distributions.

Boxplots to detect outliers in numerical data.

Bar plots to show counts of categorical variables (e.g., Sex).

5. Bivariate Analysis
Scatter plot between numerical variables (e.g., Age vs Fare).

Line plot to visualize a sorted numerical trend (e.g., sorted Fare values).
